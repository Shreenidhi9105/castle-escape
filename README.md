###	Introduction

Castle Escape is 3D videogame for PC-users created with Unity. The player wakes up in a castle and the mission is to find a way out by solving different puzzles where logical reasoning power is tested. A story about evil king is leading a player to the right direction and gives a meaning for the puzzles. There are 6 puzzle rooms available in the castle, and player must complete at least three of them to finish the game. There are also three locked doors in the castle which player must open to proceed. Doors can be opened by searching for diary pages in the castle. Diary pages leads the story of the evil king forward.  

Before the game starts, the player can customize the character. There is also a brief tutorial for how to play the game and which are the main controllers.
